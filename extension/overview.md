This will add Swimlane custom control on the work item, so we can change swimlane using dropdown.

## Usage

1. Install the extension.

2. Under Organization Settings > Extension, approve the required scopes. This extension will need access to project and team data to get swimlanes and work item write to update swimlane.

3. In Organization Settings, under Board, go to Process. Custom control can only be added under inherited process, so inherit a process and move the intended project to that process if it is not already done so.

4. Click the inherited project, under Work item types tab, select the work item type and click on "Add custom control".

5. It is best to put this control with space underneath it. Due to how the control is configured in Azure DevOps, this custom control requires around 180 px in height.
